MultimonNG a fork of multimon. It decodes the following digital transmission modes:
POCSAG512 POCSAG1200 POCSAG2400 EAS UFSK1200 CLIPFSK AFSK1200 AFSK2400 AFSK2400_2 AFSK2400_3 HAPN4800 FSK9600 DTMF ZVEI

The following changes have been made so far:
-Fixes for x64
-Basic functionality on Mac OS X 'Lion' (Soundcard/OSS input is unsupported)
-'DUMMY_AUDIO' "backend" (Gets rid of the OSS dependency, breaks audio in doing so)
-'ONLY_RAW' disables the format conversion while getting rid of posix dependencies
-Option 'NO_X11' to disable the X11 dependency since Apple will drop Xorg soon
-Override mode for POCSAG decoding (e.g. force text decoding)
-Brute-Force BCH implementation for POCSAG forward error correction
-Verbose mode is now listed in '-h'
-Merged Debian patches for EAS (Emergency Alert System) decoding (untested)
-Portability is a major goal
-Compiles on Windows (MinGW or Cygwin) without OSS/X11 and format conversion
-PulseAudio support, contributed by inf_l00p_

In addition to the deprecated legacy Makefile there is also a file for qmake which is the preferred way of building MultimonNG. It's recommended to use qmake to generate the Makefile. ('qmake multimonNG.pro && make')
So far multimonNG has been successfully built on OS X, Debian, Ubuntu and Windows. (On Windows using the Qt-MinGW build environment, as well as Cygwin)

Files can be easily converted into multimonNGs native raw format using 'sox'.
e.g. "sox -t wav pocsag_short.wav -esigned-integer -b16 -r 22050 -t raw pocsag_short.raw"
GNURadio can also generate the format using the file sink in input mode 'short'.
